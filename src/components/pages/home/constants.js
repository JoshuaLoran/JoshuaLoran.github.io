  firstBlurb: `I am a maker at heart and my love of building and puzzles have helped me easily transition into software
   engineering. I have gone from creating gadgets with Raspberry Pi's and Arduino in my spare time to becoming a full 
   stack web developer proficient in JavaScript, React, Ruby, HTML, SQL and more. I love working through problems,
    understanding the root of an issue and implementing solutions. As a lifelong student, I have a passion for learning 
    new languages and skills.`,
  secondBlurb: `Before learning to develop software, I worked many years in the restaurant industry and have proven
   experience in team management and team building as well as excellent customer service and communication skills. My 
   work ethic and management approach has never failed to bring positive quantitative and qualitative outcomes for goals
   set and people involved`
